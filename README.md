#### Getting Started

1. Open `CMD` or `Terminal`, point the path to your designed folder.
2. In the same CMD or , run `cd gulp-fe-dev`
3. Next, run `npm i` (`i` stands for `install`)
 
Now, run `gulp` from same CMD window. It will open the project server:

- `Styleguide` - `http://localhost:3000/`

Continue working, as soon as you save - it will compile CSS, and Refresh HTML too.
